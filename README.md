This is a very simple game made in shell script, meant to be tried in any bash terminal.

# Instalation

```
git clone https://github.com/AleksandarKostovic/bash-game.git
cd bash-game
sudo chmod +x game.sh
./game.sh
```
Reason for running sudo chmod is that your OS wont allow you to run shell script unless you overwrite it by doing this. If you are running as root then there is no need to use sudo, just type `chmod +x game.sh`

You should be greeted with questions now.
