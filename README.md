This is a very simple CLI game written in shell script, made for any bash terminal.

# Instalation

```
git clone https://github.com/AleksandarKostovic/bash-game.git
cd bash-game
sudo chmod +x game.sh
./game.sh
```
Reason for running sudo chmod is that your OS wont allow you to run shell script unless you overwrite it by doing this. If you are running as root then just type `chmod +x game.sh`

Enjoy.
