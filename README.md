This is a very simple game made in bash, meant to be tried in linux terminal.

# Instalation

```
git clone https://github.com/AleksandarKostovic/bash-game.git
cd bash-game
sudo chmod +x game.sh
./game.sh
```
Reason for running sudo chmod is that your OS wont allow you to run shell script unless you overwrite it by doing this
